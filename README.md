# GameSpot

The frontend for my fullstack video game rental service.

## What is GameSpot?

This is the GUI for my project and it mainly focuses on mastering React with class based components, I will mainly be using bootstrap to style my components. The main goal for this project this to successfully connect my backend and frontend along with deploying the app on heroku while keeping the code clean, maintainable and scalable.
